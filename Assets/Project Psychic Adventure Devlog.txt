Time : 08:04:41


================================================
NOV 30/11/19 Saturday
-----------------------------------------------
Weekly Summary:
Finished on the AreaDirectory scripts for navigating from one room to the next. 
Finished the Fear power and its ability to make the Ai run in terror for X seconds, just needs to be attached to the PsychicMouse script and animations for each direction.
Also finished on the new Ai improvements: a new FSM with fewer and more versatile states and being able to handle interruptions from status effects. Also introduced energy and Rest state which may look for a place to rejuvenate energy.
Discovered Unity Record pluggin record video or export frames.
Installed Mercurial version control with TortoiseHg for art.


================================================
NOV 29/11/19 Friday
-----------------------------------------------
- Added Conditions to Sleep and Judge transitions and added a hour parameter which is updated by the gamemanager's time. Thinking whether for WORK_STATE have that functionality theirein instead of relying on the conditions, advantage would be being able to easily define the hour range.
- Created Home state of WORK_STATE type and have it to go into the house when its 16:00. Home has a locked door, should disable it.
- Judge state has transition to home which triggers when the hour is after 15:00.
- Fixed a bug which WORK_STATE events with NextPath() functions were fired twice causing the ai to skip a path and attempt walking to the indoor area. Was occuring when the ai was leaving the coffeeshop to go home, OnFinishPath and OnTeleport, the events which NextPath() was subscribed to were both firing causing it to skip a path.
Used a bool which gated chaging the pathIndex in NextPath() and have the bool reset after 2 frames.
- Npc routine done, from sleep he goes to work at 7:00, still goes to work when interrupted, goes home at 16:00 and still goes home when interrupted and goes to sleep at 00:00 and loops again. Has no problem going from Home to Outdoor to Shop. Still using transition conditions instead of in built hour management, not sure if its necessary unless I need to change hours later.
- Tested with home being the Home.Room1. No problems.
- WORK_STATE can activate a gameObject when reached goal and deactivate when exited state, used to open/close access to the shop menu.
- Added Energy and drain values to AiCore, Energy depletes by drain per second, currently decided on 0.0694444444444444â€¬ per second which is 100/1440 (Number of seconds in a day).
- Created REST_STATE which recovers energy. Added impulse to CoffeeShopJob2 to go to Rest when energy <25 and go to Judge when >50.
- Fixed an oversight with BaseStateMachine which didn't call OnStateEnter of the currentState when the game starts, Start executes it.
- Changed Sleep from IDLE_STATE to SLEEP_STATE. Multiplier set to 6. Npc's starting energy to 50.
- SLEEP_STATE has the option to search for objects within 7 units with "REST" tag. If such object is found then walk to it and rejuvenate else just rejuvenate where you are.
- Changed low energy impulse parameter to use a trigger instead of a float, fixed the issue of constantly entering the state searching for a path to the bench every time.
- Written documentation about WORK_STATE.

**Goals reached! Fear Spell base and Ai Updates!**

Time : 06:13:28

================================================
NOV 28/11/19 Thursday
-----------------------------------------------
- Looking into version control for art. Decided to go with Mercurial with 
TortoiseHg. 
https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/
https://tortoisehg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick.html
- Added sound to Fear.
- Fear detects bounds with "Citizen" tag.
- AiCore has RunInFear function which handles logic when feared.
- When fear is cast the npc will run at double speed in the oposite direction.
- Fear has a duration, npc goes back to OK when times up.
- Fear now only works if the victim is within 95 degrees from its facing direction which is currently south.
- Music Practise: Exploring Plugins and 3osx for chiptunes.

Time : 06:23:06

================================================
NOV 27/11/19 Wednesday
-----------------------------------------------
- Added screenshots to the Project Psychic Adventure list in My Projects
https://trello.com/b/60Dx56Cc/my-projects
- Created Impulses in BasedStateMachine: They are a a list of transitions
which are checked on the FSM.
- Added Interruption events to AiCore, using Telekinesis and dropping the
npc triggers an event.
- Added Interrupt and Judge state. When a stun event is fired the FSM
will enter Interrupt state and Judge once the stun ends.
- WORK_STATE behaviour after being interrupted seems to reset to its original
position before resuming. Fixed that by clearing the path list upon Exit State.
- WORK_STATE has problems creating a new path if interrupted in the same
room, doesn't even move if interrupted after reaching its goal. 
Fixed it, pathIndex wasn't resetting after re-entering the WORK_STATE which
caused the Index out of Array Bounds error. 
- Discovered how to use VS Debugger for unity, thats how I fixed the above.
- Created Fear script, connects the graphics and plays them. Skull alpha 
changes by animation curve and shakes.

- Updated Astar Pathfinding to 4.2.10.
- Worked on the WORK_STATE, can cache paths before hand but has an
issue going from the next path to the end, I haven't included to
calculate paths from their new positions after using teleports.
- Fixed above! Included the teleports destination position in the
DirectionQuery so WORK_STATE knows from which point to calculate each
path. On the first iteration it will calculate against the ai's
current position.

Time : 06:01:36

================================================
NOV 25/11/19 Monday
-----------------------------------------------
Goals of the week:

saturated.
